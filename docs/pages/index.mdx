Post Yer Ale is a hoppy place where the bold and brazen cast images of their finest brews. This channel is a tribute to malty treasures and the spirit of adventure. Every pint shared is a story waiting to be told, and each cast is a toast to those who dare explore the darker depths of frothy ales and crypto lore.

<h3>Norms</h3>

1. **Savor the Ale**: Let every cast be a tribute to the brews that sustain us. Whether bitter or sweet, embrace the nectar of the gods and share your finest elixirs.

2. **The Proof of Drink**: Only those who bear the mark of the POD may have their casts ascend to the Main feed. Possession of a Proof of Drink NFT from the sacred vault of [Brood](https://pod.brood.beer/) grants you this honor.

3. **Raise Your Tankard**: When an ale cast stirs your soul, give it a hearty cheer! Should the brew be worthy, comment, like, and quote so its glory may spread far and wide.

4. **Under the Banner of Brood**: This tavern is maintained by the will of the [Brood](https://brood.beer/), a decentralized autonomous fellowship bound by ale and oath.
